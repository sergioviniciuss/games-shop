# E-commerce
This repo is in progress, and it's bootstrapped with my boilerplate: https://github.com/sergioviniciuss/boilerplate

The plan is building an e-commerce using NextJS to use Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation concepts, together with a headless CMS.
The technologies are:
* NextJS
* Typescript
* PWA
* Storybook
* GraphQL
* Styled Components

## Usage

- run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
- run `yarn dev` to run it for development purposes
- run `yarn build` to prepare the code for production and then `yarn start` to start the server.
